Ember-testing broken in the RC6 build

To run the javascript tests

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    bower install
    karma start

The above will fail as master has RC6, to pass the build

    edit the bower.json to pull down RC5 instead of RC6
    rm -rf js/vendor
    mkdir js/vendor
    bower install
    karma start
